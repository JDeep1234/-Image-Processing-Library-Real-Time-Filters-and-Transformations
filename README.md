# Image Processing Library â€“ Real-Time Filters and Transformations

## Overview

This project is an image processing library implemented in C++ using OpenCV. It allows users to apply real-time image filters (such as Gaussian blur, edge detection) and transformations (like scaling and rotation) on images. The library is optimized for performance using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) principles, making it suitable for processing large datasets efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Filters**: Apply common filters including:
  - Gaussian Blur
  - Edge Detection (Canny)
  - Sharpening

- **Image Transformations**:
  - Scaling
  - Rotation
  - Color Manipulation

- **Performance Optimization**: Utilizes SIMD for enhanced processing speed.

- **Image Format Support**: Works with common image formats like JPEG, PNG, etc.

## Extensions

Future enhancements may include:
- Advanced features such as face detection and object tracking.
- Deep learning integration using TensorFlow or OpenCV's DNN module.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following software installed:

- C++ Compiler (e.g., Visual Studio for Windows, GCC for Linux, Xcode for Mac)
- CMake
- Conan
- OpenCV

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ImageProcessingLibrary.git
   cd ImageProcessingLibrary
